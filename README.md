This is an assignment from my data science for healthy lifestyle course.
The idea of this assignment is to let us get some practice on GIS, and we can have some reflection on our JITAI report. 
You can run the file with surffix 'qgz' via QGIS software. There's a tutorial with some questions for this assignment, and additionally, there's my own answer with a combained FAIRdata part for the assignment as well.
